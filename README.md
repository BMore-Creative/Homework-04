Web application that presents users with a timed quiz on various JavaScript basics. Clicking the 'Start Quiz' button displays the first question and presents answer options for the user to choose. After a choice is selected, the next question is displayed. If the user was incorrect, time is deducted. After completion of the quiz, either by completing all available questions or running out of time, the user is allowed to input their initials for their score to be saved. They are then redirected to another page that displays all currently saved highscores in descending order. There, the user is able to clear the currently saved scores and return to the quiz.
